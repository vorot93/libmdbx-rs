    /// [SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync] the [SyncMode::SafeNoSync] flag disable similarly flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction.
    /// But there is a huge difference in how are recycled the MVCC snapshots corresponding to previous "steady" transactions (see below).
    ///
    /// With [crate::WriteMap] the [SyncMode::SafeNoSync] instructs MDBX to use asynchronous mmap-flushes to disk.
    /// Asynchronous mmap-flushes means that actually all writes will scheduled and performed by operation system on it own manner, i.e. unordered.
    /// MDBX itself just notify operating system that it would be nice to write data to disk, but no more.
    ///
    /// Depending on the platform and hardware, with [SyncMode::SafeNoSync] you may get a multiple increase of write performance, even 10 times or more.
    ///
    /// In contrast to [SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync] mode, with [SyncMode::SafeNoSync] flag MDBX will keeps untouched pages within B-tree of the last transaction "steady" which was synced to disk completely.
    /// This has big implications for both data durability and (unfortunately) performance:
    ///
    /// A system crash can't corrupt the database, but you will lose the last transactions; because MDBX will rollback to last steady commit since it kept explicitly.
    /// The last steady transaction makes an effect similar to "long-lived" read transaction since prevents reuse of pages freed by newer write transactions, thus the any data changes will be placed in newly allocated pages.
    /// To avoid rapid database growth, the system will sync data and issue a steady commit-point to resume reuse pages, each time there is insufficient space and before increasing the size of the file on disk.
    /// In other words, with [SyncMode::SafeNoSync] flag MDBX protects you from the whole database corruption, at the cost increasing database size and/or number of disk IOPs.
    /// So, [SyncMode::SafeNoSync] flag could be used with [Database::sync()](crate::Database::sync) as alternatively for batch committing or nested transaction (in some cases).
    ///
    /// The number and volume of of disk IOPs with [SyncMode::SafeNoSync] flag will exactly the as without any no-sync flags.
    /// However, you should expect a larger process's work set and significantly worse a locality of reference, due to the more intensive allocation of previously unused pages and increase the size of the database.
    SafeNoSync,

    /// Don't sync anything and wipe previous steady commits.
    ///
    /// Don't flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction.
    /// This optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database, if buffers are not yet flushed to disk.
    /// Depending on the platform and hardware, with [SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync] you may get a multiple increase of write performance, even 100 times or more.
    ///
    /// If the filesystem preserves write order (which is rare and never provided unless explicitly noted) and the [WriteMap](crate::WriteMap) and [DatabaseFlags::liforeclaim] flags are not used,
    /// then a system crash can't corrupt the database, but you can lose the last transactions, if at least one buffer is not yet flushed to disk.
    /// The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers to disk and how often [Database::sync()](crate::Database::sync) is called.
    /// So, transactions exhibit ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation) properties and only lose D (durability).
    /// I.e. database integrity is maintained, but a system crash may undo the final transactions.
    ///
    /// Otherwise, if the filesystem not preserves write order (which is typically) or [WriteMap](crate::WriteMap) or [DatabaseFlags::liforeclaim] flags are used, you should expect the corrupted database after a system crash.
    ///
    /// So, most important thing about [SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync]:
    ///
    /// A system crash immediately after commit the write transaction high likely lead to database corruption.
    /// Successful completion of [Database::sync(force=true)](crate::Database::sync) after one or more committed transactions guarantees consistency and durability.
    /// BUT by committing two or more transactions you back database into a weak state, in which a system crash may lead to database corruption!
    /// In case single transaction after [Database::sync()](crate::Database::sync), you may lose transaction itself, but not a whole database.
    /// Nevertheless, [SyncMode::UtterlyNoSync] provides "weak" durability in case of an application crash (but no durability on system failure),
    /// and therefore may be very useful in scenarios where data durability is not required over a system failure (e.g for short-lived data), or if you can take such risk.
